# My Personal Project

## what will my application?
my personal project will be revolved around a **sneaker botting profit-loss tracker with graphs**. This programme is
specifically made for sneaker-botters who like to buy sneakers on websites for retail price and re-selling them at a
higher price to make profits. This application will log weekly buys and sells and calculate **weekly** 
gross profit and net profit. Every week, the user may add a new entry. The application will also provide total gross
and net profits. Each weekly gross and net profit will be plotted as a dot on an XY axis, then the graph will connect 
the dots and show the user their process over the month or year. For clarification, these features will be included in
the programme: 
- weekly entries for **investments**, which will include:
  - purchases of sneakers with sneaker names, quantities of each sneaker, and price of each sneaker
  - purchases of proxy plans and their corresponding price (proxies are IP addresses that hinder the site from detecting 
multiple purchases from a single address).
  - purchases of third party solvers and their corresponding price (Third party solvers solve captcha for the user).
  - purchases of notification groups and their price
  - in each weekly entry, there will be weekly gross profit and weekly net profit. 
  - For all weekly entries, there will a total gross and net profit with corresponding graphs.

## who will use my application and why am I intrigued in creating it?
This application is for people who like to bot sneakers and like to have a place to organize their profits and loses. 
sneaker-botting is a very popular idea among teens and even adults, they make up a considerable community in Canada.
Me and some of my friends have been sneaker-botting for a long time. For many people, especially beginners,
it is a pain trying to keep track of profits, loses and investments. I usually keep track profits and loses on a 
Google Doc which is hard to follow sometimes. Some people like using spread-sheets however I find them really 
complicated. This gave rise to an idea to make an easy to operate and helpful profit-loss tracker.
