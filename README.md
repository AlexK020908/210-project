# My Personal Project

## what will my application?
my personal project will be revolved around a **sneaker botting profit-loss tracker**. This programme is
specifically made for sneaker-botters who like to buy sneakers on websites for retail price and re-selling them at a
higher price to make profits. This application will log  buys and sells and calculate  net profit. 
Every time the user makes a buy or sale, he/she can log entries into this application. The application will also
provide total revenue and net profits. There will be two main types of **Investment**, one is support investment, 
and the other is sneaker investment

the programme will have: 
- 4 entry options of **investments**, which will include:
- purchases of sneakers with sneaker names, quantities of each sneaker, and price of each sneaker
- purchases of proxy plans and their corresponding price (proxies are IP addresses that hinder the site from 
detecting 
multiple purchases from a single address).
- purchases of third party solvers and their corresponding price (Third party solvers solve captcha for the user).
- purchases of notification cook groups and their corresponding price

## who will use my application and why am I intrigued in creating it?
This application is for people who like to bot sneakers and like to have a place to organize their profits and loses. 
sneaker-botting is a very popular idea among teens and even adults, they make up a considerable community in Canada.
Me and some of my friends have been sneaker-botting for a long time. For many people, especially beginners,
it is a pain trying to keep track of profits, loses and investments. I usually keep track profits and loses on a 
Google Doc which is hard to follow sometimes. Some people like using spread-sheets however I find them really 
complicated. This gave rise to an idea to make an easy to operate and helpful profit-loss tracker.
