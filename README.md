# My Personal Project

## what will my application?
my personal project will be revolved around a **sneaker botting profit-loss tracker**. This programme is
specifically made for sneaker-botters who like to buy sneakers on websites for retail price and re-selling them at a
higher price to make profits. This application will log  buys and sells and calculate  net profit. 
Every time the user makes a buy or sale, he/she can log entries into this application. The application will also
provide total revenue and net profits. There will be two main types of **Investment**, one is support investment, 
and the other is sneaker investment

the programme will have: 
- 4 entry options of **investments**, which will include:
- purchases of sneakers with sneaker names, quantities of each sneaker, and price of each sneaker
- purchases of proxy plans and their corresponding price (proxies are IP addresses that hinder the site from 
detecting 
multiple purchases from a single address).
- purchases of third party solvers and their corresponding price (Third party solvers solve captcha for the user).
- purchases of notification cook groups and their corresponding price

## who will use my application and why am I intrigued in creating it?
This application is for people who like to bot sneakers and like to have a place to organize their profits and loses. 
sneaker-botting is a very popular idea among teens and even adults, they make up a considerable community in Canada.
Me and some of my friends have been sneaker-botting for a long time. For many people, especially beginners,
it is a pain trying to keep track of profits, loses and investments. I usually keep track profits and loses on a 
Google Doc which is hard to follow sometimes. Some people like using spread-sheets however I find them really 
complicated. This gave rise to an idea to make an easy to operate and helpful profit-loss tracker.

## phase 4 trask 3: 
After reflecting on my design and UML, I realized that the structure of my model classes were fine. However, I realized
a huge mistake made on my design of GUI, in fact, the structure of my GUI class was all over the place. 
As shown in the UML diagram I have many helper classes for listening to button events when a specific button is pressed.
Instead of making these classes nested classes which can have access to private fields in my GUI class, I created a new Java class outside of GUI.
By making these supposedly nested classes a new java class, it presented me with trouble
referring to private fields in my GUI class. In fact, I realized this error while working on phase but at the time did not know how to solve
this problem. For every other event listener class I created outside the GUI class, I had to pass in the fields I want access to in the GUI class into the 
constructor of the newly created listener class. For example, my **SaveActionListener** needed all of my RevenueList, SneakerPurchaseList, ThirdPartySolverPurchaseList, 
ProxyPurchase and CookGroupPurchaseList instances passed into its constructor. By creating these classes outside of my GUI class, I have created 
more than one path to a class. If starting from GUI, I want to access sneakerPurchaseList class, I have many paths. One path goes
straight from GUI to SneakerPurchaseList class, another path can be taken from GUI to addSneakerListener, and then to SneakerPurchaseListClass. This 
increases coupling which is not desired. With this mistake in mind, I also came across nested classes I have created inside of GUI class, these private 
classes inside of GUI decreased coupling. The reason why I say my structure of the GUI class was all over the place is because my structure is not consistent as 
I have both nested and non-nested classes....

In conclusion I would : 
- move all listener classes designed outside of the GUI class into the GUI class and make them private nested classes
- Cook Group Purchase List, Proxy Purchase List and Third Party Purchase List can be combined into one single class that represent one single class of support Entry list
  - However, this would make it unorganized although it would make the program simpler
- Revenue list does not have to be a list, which may provide the burden of have the field of a list of revenues. 
  - RevenueList and Revenue Class can be combined into one single class that holds one double value. Whenever the customer makes a new revenue, simply update 
the existing revenue by adding the new revenue and the existing revenue together.
- another thing I would have done is extracting a jsonWriter super class , for all the writer classes, they have identical code for the constructor, open(), and close.
  - the write method for different writers take in different parameters, therefore the method would be troublesome to extract. 
- For the json reader classes, I would have extracted a jsonReader super class that has a constructor that initializeS the file location as a string and also a method 
that reads the source file into a String and returns the string as all readers have the same code turning the source file into a string for conversion into json.
