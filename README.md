# My Personal Project

## what will my application?
My personal project will be revolved around a **gravity related platform game**. It will be consisted of one player 
where he/she starts at the bottom of the screen. There are platforms the player needs to jump on in order to reach the 
end point of the game located at the top of the screen. If the player reaches the top before the timer hits zero, he/she
wins the game. One should be able to design their own placement of platforms and name of the level. Aside from a 
player object, the game will also include the following *objects*: 
- Spike platforms, regular platforms, moving platforms, bounce pads.
- Turrets that are on some platforms that shoot bullets where each bullet is fired at a specific time interval.
  - only present when player decided to play at a more difficult level
- A finish platform that makes the player win the game. 
- Timer that counts down. 

## who will use my application and why am I intrigued in creating it?
The people that will use it are people that like to play and design quick games to pass time. Gamers will also use this 
application as 2D games have a sense of originality. This application will also intrigue players who like to design 
their own levels to challenge their friends. This project is interesting to me because I am in love with video games; 
they provide me with an escape from reality. Video games gifted me many close friends that I still have today in UBC. 
I  love 2D games; they give me a sense of originality and a feeling that I am playing in an era where video games first 
emerged. I have always been intrigued by the amount of hard work that goes into programming a video game, and I 
have always wanted to experience this incremental process myself.
